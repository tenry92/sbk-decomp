# Snowboard Kids Decompilation Project

This project tries to create an exact decompilation of the Nintendo 64 game
Snowboard Kids. The goal is to have (almost) all code in well written C files
and assets such as textures, models, sounds and music sequences in separate
files, allowing anybody to change something here and there and recreate a fully
functional N64 ROM file from these files. If no changes were done to any of the
individual files, the resulting ROM file shall completely match the original
ROM file it was decompiled from.

This project still is in a very early process and does not allow re-creating
a ROM file yet.

## About Snowboard Kids

Snowboard Kids is a fun racer game for N64 developed by Racdym. The following
versions of the original game were published:

- NTSC Japanese: December 12, 1997
- NTSC North America: February 1998
- PAL: March 16, 1998

An enhanced port named Snowboard Kids Plus was also released for the PlayStation
in January 21, 1999 in Japan only.
This version includes changed a title screen, updated menus, additional
characters and animated video sequences.

The sequel Snowboard Kids 2 was later also published for the N64, which is
probably based on the same game engine.

## Decompilation process

This project is currently developed in Linux. It makes extensive use of Linux
command line tools.

Put a ROM of Snowboard Kids (US) into this base folder and name it
**baserom.us.z64**. The *sha1sum* should be
**1583bacc9046a360df8ea4d536942155247e154c**. If this is not the case, you might
need to byteswap the file. Otherwise, you seem to have a different version of
the game.

Call `./get-tools.sh` to download and compile additional tools that are used
for decompiling SBK. In particular, it

- downloads mips_to_c
- downloads and compiles sm64tools

If it fails compiling you might be missing some tools such as a C compiler.
Check sm64tools for more information. Also ensure you have the correct version
of Python installed as required by mips_to_c.

Now you can call `./split.sh`. This

- creates a MIPS disassembly and binary files of the ROM into snowboard_kids.u.split
- updates or removes some of the autogenerated files and folders
- decompiles (previosly manually) selected assembly functions into C in **snowboard_kids.u.split/src**
- extracts assembly functions that could not be converted into C yet to **snowboard_kids.u.split/asm**
- patches are applied to the C files to make them more clear and readable

A (hopefully full) disassembly of the game should be available in
**snowboard_kids.u.split/snowboard_kids.u.s**. This file is huge.

In **snowboard_kids.u.yaml** a mapping between addresses and labels (could be
variables or functions) are provided.

In **src/globals.c** are global variables with (more or less) known data types.
